This will play the given chat sounds whenever a player types something into the chat and the word or one of the words he typed in matches the given chat sound name. More funny then simply using a command because player will trigger this when typing something random.

## Installation

1. Download and extract the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Kandru/cs2-quake-sounds/releases/).
2. Move the "QuakeSounds" folder to the `/addons/counterstrikesharp/plugins/` directory.
3. Restart the server.

Updating is even easier: simply overwrite all plugin files and they will be reloaded automatically. To automate updates please use our [CS2 Update Manager](https://github.com/Kandru/cs2-update-manager/).


## Configuration

This plugin automatically creates a readable JSON configuration file. This configuration file can be found in `/addons/counterstrikesharp/configs/plugins/QuakeSounds/QuakeSounds.json`.

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "debug": true,
  "cooldown_player": 0,
  "cooldown_global": 5,
  "play_on_player": true,
  "play_on_bots": false,
  "play_on_all_players": false,
  "sounds": {
    "de": {
      "1hp": {
        "path": "Saysound.1hp",
        "length": 0
      },
      "abgefahren": {
        "path": "Saysound.Abgefahren",
        "length": 0
      },
      "amerika": {
        "path": "Saysound.America",
        "length": 0
      }
    },

        "length": 0
      },
      "america": {
        "path": "Saysound.America",
        "length": 0
      }
  },
  "muted": [
    "[U:1:33290010]"
  ],
  "ConfigVersion": 1
}
```

Sounds need to be categorized per language. If the player language is not found (and also not the server language) the first found language of the *sounds* dictionary will be used. This dictionary automatically sorts by alphabetically order to allow easier changes to the sound list. This will happen automatically each time the plugin gets loaded.

Sounds need to be inside an workshop addon sound definition file. Otherwise only default sounds from the cs2 internal sound definition files are possible to use.
